# Restaurant Data Classification and Pattern Analysis Using Decision Tree Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **restaurant-related data** and performing **classification and pattern analysis** using a **Decision Tree algorithm**, a supervised machine learning technique.

The goal of the project is to learn patterns from restaurant data such as customer preferences, service attributes, or operational factors, and classify outcomes based on these patterns. Decision Trees are chosen for their simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in classification tasks.

## Objectives
- To analyze restaurant dataset attributes
- To apply Decision Tree algorithm for classification
- To identify hidden patterns in restaurant data
- To evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## Dataset Description
The **restaurant dataset** contains structured data related to restaurant operations or customer-related factors.  
It is used to train and test the Decision Tree classifier.

### Dataset Characteristics
- Type: Structured tabular data
- Domain: Restaurant / Food Service Analytics
- Format: CSV
- Used for supervised classification

### example Attributes (may vary based on dataset)
- Restaurant type
- Location
- Service quality
- Pricing range
- Customer rating
- Waiting time
- Class label (e.g., customer satisfaction / decision outcome)

The dataset is loaded and processed directly inside the Jupyter Notebook.
